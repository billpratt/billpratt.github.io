## Hi I'm Bill!

My name is Bill Pratt. I am a Lead Software Engineer with over 11 years experience. 
I live in the world of containers, microservices, and the cloud. I'm excited about all things technology and when a challenge comes along I say bring it on. I'm always learning, never stagnant. I love working in the cloud. I want to write code that people value, makes their lives easier, makes a difference and possibly changes the world. In my free time, I'm a [speaker](/speaking), blogger, [contribute to the open source](https://github.com/billpratt) and research on the latest tech trends.

Primary Focus:
* Microservices
* C#, .NET Core, Javascript
* ASP.NET Core, ASP.NET
* Docker, Kubernetes
* Azure
