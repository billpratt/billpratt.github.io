Hi, I'm Bill! I finally decided to start a blog, and as my first post I thought I'd give a little intro about myself. I am a husband to a wonderful wife, a father to three beautiful girls, a Software Engineer, a gamer, and overall geek. I have been writing software for over 10 years and have been loving every minute of it.  I like to explore many aspects of tech, and with this blog I will share my adventures.

Thanks for stopping by,
Bill
